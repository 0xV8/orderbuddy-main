## 🚀 Tasks & Workflow

All tasks are tracked in [`docs/tasks.md`](docs/tasks.md)  
AI agent Nova will read and complete tasks from this list.

## 🔐 Git Strategy

- `main`: Stable, tagged releases
- `develop`: Active development
- `feature/*`: New features
- `release/*`: Release prep and hotfixes

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

The project uses Azure Application Insights for error tracking and telemetry:

- **Error Logging**: Automatic tracking of exceptions across the application
- **Performance Monitoring**: API calls, page loads, and custom metrics
- **User Telemetry**: Track feature usage and user journeys

See [Manage App Application Insights Documentation](src/manage/README-APPLICATION-INSIGHTS.md) for setup and usage.
